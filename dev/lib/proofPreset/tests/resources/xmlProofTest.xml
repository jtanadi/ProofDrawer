This is a test xml file
Everything until the first <group> should be ignored

So this is space for explanation, notes etc.

<group>
UC, lc, numerals
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
0123456789
</group>
<group>
UC control
|H| |O| HOHOHOHO
|A| HAHAHAOAOAOA
|B| HBHBHBOBOBOB
|C| HCHCHCOCOCOC
</group>

<group>
lc control
|n| |o| nononono
|a| nananaoaoaoa
|b| nbnbnbobobob
|c| ncncncocococ
</group>

Everything after the last </group> will also be ignored
so maybe a thank you letter goes here.
