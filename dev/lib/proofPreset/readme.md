# Proof Preset
A Preset object for `ProofDrawer()`.

## Structure
`ProofPreset()` objects are nested collections (lists and dicts) and have this structure:
```python
{
    "name": "My Favorite Preset",
    "groups" [
        {
            "name": "UC, lc",
            "type size": 10,
            "leading": 12,
            "print": True,
            "contents": [
                "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
                "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Numerals, symbols",
            "type size": 10,
            "leading": 12,
            "print": False,
            "contents": [
                "1234567890",
                "!@#$%^&*()"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Each item in the `contents` list is a line of proof string.

At initialization, a `ProofPreset()` object only has `name` (`"myPreset"` by default, unless passed in by user) and `groups`, which is an empty list.

```python
myPreset = ProofPreset() # Default preset name is "myPreset"
coolPreset = ProofPreset("Cool Preset") # Preset name is "Cool Preset"
```

## Public Methods
A Preset object comes with a handful of public methods. These methods are "plugged-in" to the `ProofDrawer()` UI.

### Importing Stuff
Users can import XML-tagged strings or lists, JSON-formatted presets, or Python-formatted presets. Right now, the `ProofPreset()` object doesn't read or write files. _(Maybe it should?)_

#### `importFromXML(xmlTaggedProof)`
Import from XML-tagged proof document. `xmlTaggedProof` can be a string or a list (depending on whether the user uses `read()` or `readlines()`).

XML-tagged proof documents aren't presets, but only a list of proof "groups". Each group must be wrapped in `<group>` / `</group>` tags and the first line of each group is its group name. Each subsequent line in a group is one item in that group's `contents` list.

For example:
```
<group>
UC
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
</group>

<group>
UC between control chars
|H| |O| HHHOHOHOOOHO
|A| HHHAHAAAOOOAOAAA
|B| HHHBHBBBOOOBOBBB
|C| HHHCHCCCOOOCOCCC
...
</group>
```

Before fully importing, `ProofPreset()` performs some basic cleaning & validation: 
- Remove empty lines or list items and leading or trailing whitespaces
- Check if tags exist at all
- Check if tags are in correct sequence (open, close, open, close, etc.). If any part of the validation process fails, an `XMLtagError` is raised.

Because `xmlTaggedProof` isn't a preset (ie. doesn't contain other data like `type size`), `ProofPreset()` will inject empty values into each group.

```python
proofStr = "<group>\nUC\nABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n</group>"
proofList = ["<group>", "UC", "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", "</group>"]

myPreset.importFromXML(proofList) # Either object is fine
myPreset.getPreset()
>>> {
        "name": "Best Preset"
        "groups" [
            {
                "name": "UC",
                "type size": "",
                "leading": "",
                "print": False,
                "contents": [
                    "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
```

#### `importFromJSON(jsonObj, overwrite=False)`
Import an entire preset from a JSON object and convert to `ProofPreset()` object. Since each `ProofPreset()` object can only contain one preset, if `overwrite=False`, a `ProofPresetError` will be raised.

This method simply converts a JSON object into a Python dictionary and passes it to the `importPreset()` method, so it has the same restrictions / requirements / processes as described below.

```python
myPreset.importFromJSON(someJSONobject)
```

### `importPreset(presetToImport, overwrite=False)`
Import an entire preset from a Python dict. If `overwrite=False`, a `ProofPresetError` will be raised if the `ProofPreset()` object isn't empty.

Imported presets must have a name and at least one groupâ€”otherwise it's just an empty preset, which is the same as what we get when we initialize `ProofPreset()`. 

Before fully importing, `ProofPreset()` performs some basic tasks:
- Remove unnecessary keys in each group. The only group keys relevant to `ProofPreset()` are `name`, `type size`, `leading`, `print`, `contents`; everything else will be removed. If one of those keys is missing, it will be added to the group.

```python
myPreset.importPreset(newPreset)
myPreset.getPreset()
>>> {
        "name": "Newnew_FINAL"
        "groups" [
            {
                "name": "UC",
                "type size": 8,
                "leading": 10,
                "print": False,
                "contents": [
                    "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
                ]
            },
            {
                "name": "lc",
                "type size": 8,
                "leading": 10,
                "print": True,
                "contents": [
                    "0123456789"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
```

This method can be combined with `getPreset()` to make a copy of a `ProofPreset()` object. `importPreset()` uses `deepcopy()`, so the same preset isn't referenced by both objects.

```python
preset1Data = preset1.getPreset()

preset1Copy = ProofPreset() # Don't have to specify name because it'll get replaced anyway
preset1Copy.importPreset(preset1Data) # At this point the two objects have the same name
preset1Copy.renamePreset("Copy of preset 1") # So we should rename it
```

### Adding, Moving, and Removing Groups

### Getting Stuff
Users have access to all data through `ProofDrawer()`, either through the main window or its auxiliary windows (Proof Inspector, Preset Inspector).

The only thing that `ProofDrawer()` generates on its own is each group's "order" number, which is simply that group's index within `ProofPreset["groups"]` + 1.

#### `getGroupNames()`
Return a list of group names.
```python
myPreset.getGroupNames()
>>> ["UC", "lc", "numerals"]
```

#### `getGroups(verbose=True)`
Return a list of groups. By default, return all of the data associated with each group. If `verbose=False`, only return the group name and group contents.
```python
myPreset.getGroups()
>>> [
        {
            "name": "UC",
            "type size": 12,
            "leading": 14,
            "print": True,
            "contents": ["ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"]
        },
        {
            "name": "lc",
            "type size": 10,
            "leading": 10,
            "print": False,
            "contents": ["abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"]
        }
    ]

myPreset.getGroups(verbose=False)
>>> [
        {
            "name": "UC",
            "contents": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
        },
        {
            "name": "lc",
            "contents": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
        }
    ]
```

#### `getPresetName()`
Return name of `ProofPreset()` object
```python
myFirstPreset = ProofPreset("My First Preset")
myFirstPreset.getPresetName()
>>> "My First Preset"
```

#### `getPreset(jsonFormat=False)`
Return the entire `ProofPreset()` as a Python dict. If `jsonFormat=True`, return the JSON object instead (basically a long string) with 2 spaces for indentation.
```python
myPreset.getPreset():
>>> {
        "name": "My Preset",
        "groups": [
            {
                "name": "UC",
                "type size": 10,
                "leading": 12,
                "print": True,
                "contents": ["ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"]
            },
            {
                "name": "lc",
                "type size": 10,
                "leading": 12,
                "print": False,
                "contents": ["abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwyxz"]
            },
            {
                "name": "numerals",
                "type size": 10,
                "leading": 12,
                "print": False,
                "contents": ["0123456789"]
            },
        ]
    }
```
